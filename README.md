• Developed a regression model in Scikit-learn to predict crop yields using soil, weather, 
and input datasets. 
• Optimized accuracy by 15% through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning 
(achieved R² = 0.91, RMSE reduced to 12.3). 
• Delivered insights that supported data-driven decisions for agri-tech applications.
